<p>INSPIRE is a network for relocated partners to inspire, support and motivate each other. We share good vibes and tips to ease the bumps in your relocation or journey abroad. 

If youâ€™re in the East Bay area, we organize events and activities to help you meet people, support one another, face the challenges together of living in a different country or state, develop your personal and professional life and discover what the San Francisco Bay Area has to offer! 

Join a lively international community to practice speaking English in a super casual environment and enjoy something new every week.
